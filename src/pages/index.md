## Web developer specializing in accessibility

I have been working in digital since 2008, as a web developer full-time since 2016, and specializing in accessibility since 2021.

The majority of my work has involved digital transformations. Past work has included marketing rebrands and website redesigns for nonprofits where I served as web developer and content, project, email marketing, and social media manager.

I am now in state government and focusing on front-end development and accessibility. Current digital transformations include auditing and remediation of existing websites and incorporating accessibility practices into design, development, and content creation for current and future projects.
