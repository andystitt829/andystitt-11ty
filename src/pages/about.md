I built my first websites as a bored teenager in 1998. I experimented with Tripod, GeoCities, and Angelfire.

No matter where my college years or career path took me, I always had an interest in building websites. I had my first opportunity to do so professionally ten years after creating my first website and haven't looked back since.

I love being in the "tech for good" space and building digital properties that improve people's lives. For a long time, that was in the nonprofit world. After a quick stop in pharma marketing working with companies who treat rare diseases, I now find myself in state government.

Accessibility is now a major focus of mine (took far too long, but better late than never). I love spending my days building and maintaining government websites that are accessible to the people that they serve.

Though most of my experience is with WordPress, I enjoy experimenting with other technologies, including static site generators like Gatsby and NextJS (I have used both for headless WordPress experimentation). This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
