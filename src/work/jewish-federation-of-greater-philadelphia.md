This was my first job as a full-time professional web developer.

I served as a technical project manager for a [redesigned and redeveloped website](https://jewishphilly.org/) from Drupal to WordPress. When the site was built and launched by an external agency, I became the lead developer.

I built website pages and added functionality such as an event calendar using the [Modern Tribe Events Calendar plugin](https://theeventscalendar.com/) and donation and event registration forms using the [Gravity Forms plugin](https://www.gravityforms.com/).

I helped create a robust content marketing program by designing and developing e-newsletters and landing pages. The main e-newsletter became the third highest source of web traffic behind organic search and direct traffic with an average open rate of 23% and click-through rate of 4%.

The website transformation and content marketing program reinvigorated the brand and increased website visits by 25%, new visitors by 30%, and event registrations by 28%.

I implemented HubSpot as the new marketing CRM to be able to more easily tie specific email, social, and search engine marketing campaigns to lead and donation conversions.
