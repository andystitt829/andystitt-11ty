## Dudnyk

I had a brief contract assignment with a pharma marketing firm that specializes in companies that treat rare diseases.

I built websites with HTML, Sass CSS, Bootstrap JavaScript/jQuery, and PHP. I also built emails with an HTML template and MJML, and I built Google banner ads with the Greensock JavaScript animation library.

I first used Browserstack and Email on Acid for cross-browser and cross-email client compatibility testing.

## Full-time freelancing

I freelanced full-time for seven months to become a full-time web developer using WordPress. I provided customer support to a company that sold off-the-shelf WordPress themes and did custom site builds. I also provided post-launch support for the [Moms Meet website](https://momsmeet.com/).

I first used version control with Github and Bitbucket and also used Bootstrap for the first time while freelancing. I also did some email template editing in Marketo.

## Side freelance projects

I've done two redesign and redevelopment projects for my boxing trainer, the most recent one to reflect his [new virtual training brand](https://virtualboxingfitness.com/) since the start of the pandemic. This website takes advantage of WordPress Full Site Editing.

I also implemented a brand design into a Squarespace website for my former coworker's [financial consulting business](https://www.jpnadvisory.com/).
