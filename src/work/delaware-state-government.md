I currently work for the [Government Information Center](https://gic.delaware.gov) within the Delaware Department of State. We build and maintain WordPress websites for Delaware state government agencies.

## Website Builds

The largest project I've worked on is the [Delaware COVID-19 information website](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov). I did the original wireframe for it, contributed code to the initial build, and then served as lead developer. I also built a COVID testing calendar using the [Modern Tribe Events Calendar plugin](https://theeventscalendar.com/).

I also built the [Delaware Public Health Alerts website](https://publichealthalerts.delaware.gov), which contains information about various health topics including COVID-19, the flu, and mpox.

Here are other websites where I've contributed code:

- [Delaware.gov](https://delaware.gov)
- [Department of Labor](https://labor.delaware.gov)
- [Childrenâ€™s Department](https://kids.delaware.gov)
- [Governor's Office](https://governor.delaware.gov/)
- [Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs](https://history.delaware.gov/)

## Accessibility Work

In the wake of COVID-19, with so many people staying home and needing to access services online, accessibility became a top priority.

My team did audits of the sites we manage and fixed common components deployed across all sites for color contrast and code-level errors.

We are also incorporating accessibility testing into design and development work at the beginning of projects instead of at the end.
