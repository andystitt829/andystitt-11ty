This was my first job in tech. In addition to managing the scholarships and awards program, I managed the static HTML website and built a new email marketing program and social media program.

An external agency was hired to rebrand the organization, and the website was redesigned and redeveloped on Sitecore CMS. I became the content manager for the new website and also upgraded the scholarship application software to a new platform.

The website and social and email marketing transformations resulted in increased website engagement.

When I worked there, the website was at PMIEF.org but has now been merged in with the [parent company's website](https://www.pmi.org/pmi-educational-foundation/).
